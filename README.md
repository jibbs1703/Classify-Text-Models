# Text Classification 

## Overview
This repository contains projects that classify text data using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. The projects demonstrate real-world use-cases of Natural Language Processing. The tasks completed cover disaster tweet classification, spam message detection, and fake news recognition.

## Projects
